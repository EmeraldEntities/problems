# Pain and Agony: A Collection of CS/BBA Problems and Exercises

This is an [open archive](https://agony.retrocraft.ca) of practice problems
from my classes in the Waterloo/Laurier CS/BBA program. Some of them cause quite the pain and agony.
These are published with the belief that they are permitted by relevant faculty,
please [contact me](mailto:jahyong@uwaterloo.ca) if they are not and I will take them down.

These were originally published alongside my personal assignments
([link](https://retrocraft.github.io/assignments)),
but I figured it may be helpful to make this open to contributions as well.

Feel free to make a pull request for anything you think would be relevant!
I make a lot of mistakes, after all.

## Contributing

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/retrocraft/problems)

The easiest way to contribute is to use GitPod,
which will automatically create a development environment
with LaTeX installed and all the setup necessary.

Otherwise, keep in mind that:

- You _should_ be a student in the relevant class to contribute,
  since you should not otherwise have access to these problems.
- LaTeX macros used in multiple files are placed in `agony.cls`. Make sure it's on the path.
- Some packages used (notably for code highlighting) require `-shell-escape`.
- Formatting is done with `latexindent`. I'm not a huge stickler for indentation.
- PDF files are added to the repository so they may be served by GitHub Pages.
- Since this was forked and redacted (Policy 71!), the commit history is a bit messy. Sorry.
